# Online Food Classification Project

**Step 1:** Load and Preprocess the Dataset
1.	Load the Dataset:
    - Load the onlinefoods.xlsx dataset into your environment.
2.	Handle Missing Values:
    - Fill in the missing values for both categorical and numerical columns.
3.	Encode Categorical Variables:
    - Apply one-hot encoding to the categorical variables.
4.	Check for Outliers:
    - Inspect the numerical columns for outliers and address them as needed.

**Step 2:** Split Data into Training and Testing Sets: 
- Split the processed dataset into training and testing sets.

**Step 3:** Train and Evaluate Models
1.	Train Models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree Classifier
2.	Evaluate Performance:
    - Evaluate each model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
